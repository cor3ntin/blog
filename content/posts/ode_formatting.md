title: "An Ode To Code Formatting Tools"

*Your modifications fix the calculation\
But I’m afraid you forgot a tabulation.\
This is the beginning of your tribulation.\
Your perfect correction won’t bring you elation.*

*If there was a way to just automate,\
Maybe you could avoid arguing with your mate.\
Should there be a space after the bracket\
How many white spaces, How many line breaks*

*Did you know tools could format your troubles away?\
You have to choose, there is no midway\
Tool-able or arguably palatable?\
Tastefulness is debatable, not checkable!*

*You may be expressionist or constructivist.\
Alas the whole situation is surrealist.\
Kernighanists are not great artists\
Neither are Whitesmiths and Allmanists, that’s the gist.*

*I too like Guillaume Apollinaire.\
Hand crafted alignment falls in disrepair.\
Are you trying to win the IOCCC ?\
Your sole concern should be consistency.*

*There is no value in what is invisible.\
No semantic in what is not expressible.\
A line break or not, what’s the différance\
For Git, noisy inconvenient difference*

*Is indentation really communicative?\
Of what can emptiness be indicative?\
There is no point, your patch is not applicable\
Not comparable, not even shareable.*

*For the love or your project’s contributors\
Don’t act like an art gallery curator.\
Clear rules should control the look of each line\
Put them in an enforceable guideline*

*It took a while, now we have modern tools.\
The have limitations and act like fools.\
For they have one goal, uniformity.\
Pick a style then use it consistently.*

*Your code won’t be magnificent and perfect.\
But it will be readable, it’s what I expect.\
Tool-able, Merge-able, Refactor-able\
Qualities that I find truly adorable.*

*Pick a style then use it consistently.\
Then concentrate on things that matter really.\
And so use a tool and accept its caveats\
For your productivity, use clang-format.*
